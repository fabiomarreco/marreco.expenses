I wanted to write a blog post for a long time, but usually get sidetracked thinking about the content.

This time, I am deep diving into DDD (Domain Driven Design), and I´m overwhelmed by insights that I wanted to share. It is a old practice, but largely ignored by the average developer, and I´ve come to realize that modeling is the main reason why projects fail, or succeed.

So I´ll make an effort to share my experience on that matter, helping others that are also seeking this journey, and hopefully learning a lot along the way.

I tend to wander when learning new things, which is really not helpful when trying to share knowledge, so I´ll create a fictional project, with partial goals that we can look up to.


Domain Driven Design is a technique that is really helpful to complex requirements. So we will need to balance the requirements complexity so that it does not deviate too much into  specifics, keeping us from learning the essence of DDD, and also not too simple, so that the technique can show its value.

DDD is heavily dependent on a cooperation between developers and domain experts.

First, I´ll lay out the *initial* software requirements, (which can change as we go along, like real projects ;) )
